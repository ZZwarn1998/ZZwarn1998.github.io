Hello there! :wave: My name is Zhicheng Zhang. I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronic Information Science and Technology from the School of Computer Science and Technology at the China University of Mining and Technology. Recently, I was thrilled to be admitted to the University of Utah and will pursue my Master of Science in Computer Science at the Kahlert School of Computing. I am especially passionate about topics including Computer Systems, Software Engineering, and Computer Graphics. Meanwhile, I am also an enthusiast of everything related to art, like painting, photography, artifacts, music, and bodybuilding. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in communicating with me.
